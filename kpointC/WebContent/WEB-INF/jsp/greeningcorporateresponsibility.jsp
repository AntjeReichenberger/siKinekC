			<h1>Greening Corporate Responsibility</h1>
			<br />
			<p>You are committed to environmental sustainability and reducing your organization's carbon footprint. You've improved your operations to make your organization run as environmentally efficiently as possible but have you considered what's happening beyond your office walls?
			<br /><br />Your employees are a huge asset in your quest to effect positive change. While encouraging employees to practice environmentally sound habits while at work is an excellent start, you can decrease their carbon footprint even further by encouraging them to use environmentally friendly products and services outside of the office - services like Kinek.
			<br /><br />When an employee reduces their carbon footprint as a result of information you have given them,<br />you are taking another step towards improving your own positive impact on the environment.</p>

					<h3>Help Your Employees Reduce Their Carbon Footprints by Greening Their Deliveries</h3>
					<p>Shopping online and sending deliveries to a KinekPoint doesn't just save employees time; it can also help reduce their carbon footprint. Here are just three ways that using Kinek and shopping online can help green employee deliveries:</p>
					
					<br /><br />
					
					<img src="resource/images/green/greeningcorporate_reducefuelconsumption.jpg" width="68" height="53" alt="Reduce fuel consumption" class="floatRight" />
					<p><strong>Reduce fuel consumption.</strong> When your employees shop online, they avoid driving around town and spending time in an idling car. Less parking spaces and traffic congestion means more green spaces.</p>
					
					<br /><br />
					
					<img src="resource/images/green/greeningcorporate_lessenergy.jpg" width="129" height="66" alt="Fewer goods shipped means less energy used" class="floatLeft" />
					<p><strong>Fewer goods shipped means less energy used.</strong> When your employees shop online, only the items they decide to purchase are shipped from the manufacturer (as opposed to the overstocking and returning of items that traditional retailers have to deal with).</p>
					
					<br /><br />
					
					<img src="resource/images/green/greeningcorporate_cleanerair.jpg" width="102" height="95" alt="Cleaner air in employee neighborhoods" class="floatRight" />
					<p><strong>Cleaner air in employee neighborhoods.</strong> When people in and around an employee's neighborhood all ship to a KinekPoint, they reduce the number of miles delivery trucks have to travel. Fewer stops means less fuel consumption and, since someone will always be at a KinekPoint to accept your employee's parcel, there are no repeat delivery attempts.</p>

						<h3>Did you know..?</h3>
						<p>When UPS reduced left hand turns in 2007, the impact on the environment was undeniable. This one change shaved almost <strong>30 million miles</strong> from delivery routes and resulted in a <strong>savings of 3 million gallons of gas</strong>. The reduction of emissions was equivalent to <strong>removing 5,300 passenger cars from the road</strong> for one year.*</p>
