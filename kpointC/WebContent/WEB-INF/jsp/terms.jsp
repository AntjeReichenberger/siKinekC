								<li>For loss or damage to any Package claims must be filed
									no later than thirty (30) days after the shipment date of the
									Package to a KinekPoint.</li>
								<li>Where YOU have made a claim in writing in respect of
									loss or damage to a Package, YOU shall on request provide
									copies of relevant documentation, evidence of the loss or
									damage and present any damaged Package for inspection. If KINEK
									has requested such documentation, information or proof in
									support of such claim, such information must be provided to
									KINEK within thirty (30) days failing which any claim will be
									deemed withdrawn.</li>
								<li>KINEK shall in any event be discharged from all
									liability whatsoever and howsoever arising in respect of the
									Package unless a suit or action is brought within six (6)
									months from the shipment date.</li>
								<li>Where claims are not filed or suits are not instituted
									thereon in accordance with the foregoing provisions, such
									claims shall be deemed waived and will not be paid.</li>

						<li>INVESTIGATION OF CLAIMS FOR LOSS OR DAMAGE TO PACKAGE:
							<ol>
								<li>Prompt Investigation: For each claim for loss or damage
									to a package or shipment filed in the manner prescribed herein
									KINEK will make a reasonable effort to promptly and thoroughly
									investigate, if an investigation has not already been made
									prior to the claim.</li>
								<li>Supporting Documents: A necessary part of the
									investigation requires that each claim be supported by the
									following: evidence of the payment and shipping of a Package to
									a KinekPoint and any declared value charges; and either the
									original invoice or an exact copy thereof, or an extract made
									there from, certified by YOU to be true and correct with
									respect to the Package and cost thereof involved in the claim.</li>
								<li>iii. Original Packaging Materials: The original
									packaging materials must be made available to KINEK or its
									designee for inspection in the event that a claim is made for
									damage to a Package.</li>
							</ol></li>
						<li>VERIFICATION OF LOSS: When an asserted claim for loss of
							an entire package or an entire shipment cannot be otherwise
							authenticated upon investigation, KINEK will obtain from the
							KinekPoint involved a certified statement in writing that the
							property for which the claim is filed has not been received from
							any other source. KINEK reserves the right to require
							verification by the filing of a police report and providing a
							copy of the filed report to KINEK in support of the claim.</li>
						<li>SALVAGE: When KINEK pays the actual cost, the purchase
							price, or the replacement cost of the Package, all rights, title
							to, and interest in the Package shall thereupon pass to KINEK,
							and KINEK reserves the right to obtain the Package for salvage.
							Payment of a claim in such circumstances shall be contingent on
							KINEK’s receipt of the damaged Package in the same condition as
							on the date the damage was incurred.</li>
						<li>DISPOSITION OF CLAIMS FOR LOSS OR DAMAGE TO PACKAGE:
							KINEK or its designee, after receiving a written claim for
							Package received by a KinekPoint, will pay, decline or make a
							firm compromise settlement offer in writing to the claimant
							within one hundred-twenty (120) days after KINEK receives the
							claim. No claim for loss or damage shall be paid unless a valid
							claim has been filed in accordance with set forth herein Section
							18 ("Claims for Loss or Damage to Package"). KINEK reserves the
							right to refuse to pay any claim for loss or damage to Package
							until all outstanding charges owing to KINEK have been paid in
							full.</li>
