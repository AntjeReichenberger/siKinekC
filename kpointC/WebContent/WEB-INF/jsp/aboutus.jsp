			<!-- ABOUT US -->
			<h1>About Kinek</h1>
				<p>Kinek has a nationwide network of trusted businesses, also known as KinekPoints, who receive and store packages for you that may have been ordered online, from catalogues, or even sent from home during the holidays. We'll ping you with an email and text message the moment your package arrives at your KinekPoint, so you can pick it up when cruising for home.   </p>
				<p>Who hasn't had a bad experience missing a delivery, had a package gone missing, or wasted time trying to track a package down from a courier outlet? It can be a nightmare and from this flawed process Kinek was formed. Kinek has built a network of over and 1,000 KinekPoint locations and we are continuing to expand adding new locations daily, so don't worry if there isn't one next to your work or home just yet. </p>
				<p>Kinek is also home to the popular border network along the U.S/Canadian border. Canadians visit Kinek border locations every day to pick up their U.S. purchases that cannot be delivered to Canada. Over 50% of U.S. retailers don't ship to Canada and Kinek is the secure and trusted solution Canadians love.</p>
				<p>Kinek is also partnering with ecommerce companies to fulfill their customer's wants and needs and is able to provide consumers who shop online with an alternative address that is convenient for them. It's a simple concept but it speaks volumes when you really need it.</p>
